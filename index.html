        <div class ="otherthing">
            <p>My name is <strong>Spencer Kifell</strong>. I'm currently a second-year student at John Abbott College in the Computer Science Technology program. I'm currently located in Montreal, Canada and have strong aspirations to develop efficient algorithms in effort of improving the lives of others. <br><br> Technology has been an extremely important part of my life for as long as I can remember. I began programming when I was much younger, initially it was just little tools that would help me out in my daily life. As for programming languages, I'm currently knowledgeable in C, C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Bash. <br><br> Casually speaking, I'm just like your typical programmer, that being introverted and spending the vast majority of my days in front of my monitors. Aside from personal projects, during my free time I usually find myself playing various video games and collaborating with my peers.</p>
