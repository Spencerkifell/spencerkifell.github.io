                <p>YouTube didn't inspire me but rather it's content creators, I was always pulled to tutorials or reviews of certain technologies. This would often lead to knowledge enhancement</p>

                <p>Python was the first language I learnt during high school and that being said it got me thinking a lot more than I was used to regarding solutions to daily tasks.</p>

                <p>Arduino was one of the first pieces of technology that got me into computer hardware. I made a mechanical hand and a controller for it which was essentially a glove with flex sensors.</p>

                <p>Steam got me interested in software development considering it's been a platform I've used for several years to play games and be in touch with the community.</p>

                <p>Minecraft was one of the first games I had ever played on a computer. When introduced to Minecraft several years ago it quite literally acted as a building block surrounding my knowledge of computers. First it was installing a wide variety of mods to the game from the internet. Eventually, it also introduced me into VPNs considering we had to use Hamachi at the time if we wanted to make a private server to play on.</p>
